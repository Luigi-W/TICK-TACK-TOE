# TICK-TACK-TOE

This will forever be a piece of code I'm proud of above many others. My first working game... 
I remember showing it to my family and friends with a big smile and often receiving looks of confusion as it runs directly from the terminal.
But for me it is special and holds many a sentimental value.

Description:

This will forever be a piece of code I'm very proud of. My first working game... 
It was the first time I combined concepts of arrays, functions, for-loops and while-loops in one application. So it felt pretty next level at the time.
I remember showing it to my family and friends with a big smile and often receiving looks of confusion as it runs directly from the terminal.
But for me it is special and holds sentimental value.
